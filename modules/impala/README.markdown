## Module Description

Management of Cloudera Impala cluster. All services can be separated across all nodes or collocated as needed.

Puppet >= 3.x is required.

Supported are:

* **Debian 7/wheezy**: tested with CDH 5.4.7/5.5.0, Impala 2.2.0/2.3.0
* **Ubuntu 14/trusty**
* **RHEL 6 and clones**

Security is not working ([IMPALA-2645](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-2645)).

## Setup

<a name="affects"></a>
### What impala affects

* Packages: installs Impala packages as needed
* Files modified:
 * */etc/impala/conf/\**
 * */etc/default/impala*
 * */usr/local/sbin/impmanager* (when requested in *features*)
* Alternatives:
 * alternatives are used for /etc/impala/conf
 * this module switches to the new alternative by default, so the original configuration can be kept intact
* Helper files:
 * */var/lib/impala/.puppet-\**
* Users:
 * *impala* system user and group are created (from packages or by puppet)
* Secret Files:
 * permissions of keytab are modified (default location: */etc/security/keytabs/impala.service.keytab*)
* Services: setup and start Impala services as needed (catalog, server, statestore)

<a name="requirements"></a>
### Setup Requirements

#### Hadoop cluster

Hadoop cluster is required. This puppet module should be applied after the Hadoop cluster is orchestrated. For example when using *cesnet-hadoop* module:

    Class['::hadoop::common::hdfs::config'] -> Class['::impala::common::config']
    Class['::hbase::common::config'] -> Class['::impala::common::config']

Some settings of Hadoop cluster are required:

* *dfs.datanode.hdfs-blocks-metadata.enabled*=*true*
* *dfs.client.read.shortcircuit*=*true*
* *dfs.domain.socket.path* set to location writable by datanodes

Native Hadoop library should be installed.

It is not recommended to install impala nodes on HDFS Name Node: installing on Name Nodes provides no additional data locality, and executing queries with such a configuration might cause memory contention and negatively impact the HDFS Name Node.

#### Hive

**Hive metastore** service is required. You can use *cesnet-hive* puppet module for it (*hive* and *hive::metastore* classes), recommended with MySQL or PostgreSQL database backends (*puppetlabs-postgresql* or *puppetlabs-mysql* puppet modules for example).

**Hive group** (group ownership of HDFS directory */user/hive/warehouse*) must be assigned to the *impala* user.

This is handled automatically. Just make sure the *group* parameter has the proper value (the same as used in hive), defaults are OK.

 1. In deployment with Sentry: we're is using 'hive' group by default and impala is assigned to that group:

    usermod -G hive -a impala

 2. In deployment without Sentry: we're using 'users' group by default and impala is assigned to that group:

    usermod -G users -a impala

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

<a name="begin"></a>
### Beginning with Impala

**Basic example:**

    class { 'impala':
    }

    include ::impala::frontend
    include ::impala::statestore
    include ::impala::catalog
    include ::impala::server

**Cluster example:**

    class { 'impala':
      catalog_hostname    => 'master.example.com',
      statestore_hostname => 'master.example.com',
      servers             => ['node1.example.com', 'node2.example.com', 'node3.example.com'],
    }

    node example.com {
      include ::impala::frontend
    }

    node master.example.com {
      include ::impala::statestore
      include ::impala::catalog
    }

    node /node\d+\.example\.com/ {
      include ::impala::server
    }

<a name="multinn"></a>
###Cluster with more HDFS Name nodes

If there are used more HDFS Name Nodes in the Hadoop cluster (high availability, namespaces, ...), it is needed to have 'impala' system user on all of them to authorization work properly. You could install Impala daemons (using *impala::server*), but just creating the user is enough (using *impala::user*).

Note, the *impala::hdfs* class is available too. It is not needed to use this class (it is here only for similarity with other addons), but it includes the *impala::user*, so *impala::hdfs* can be called instead.

**Example**:

    node <HDFS_NAMENODE> {
      include ::impala::hdfs
    }

    node <HDFS_OTHER_NAMENODE> {
      include ::impala::user
    }

<a name="class-impala"></a>
### `impala` class

Configure Impala Puppet Module.

####`alternatives`

Switches the alternatives used for the configuration. Default: 'cluster' (Debian) or undef.

It can be used only when supported (for example with Cloudera distribution).

####`catalog_hostname`

Default: $::fqdn.

####`debug_enable`

Install also debug package and enable core dumps. Default: false.

####`group`

Hive group on HDFS. Default: 'users' (without sentry), 'hive' (with sentry).

*impala* user is added to this group.

####`features`

Enable additional features. Default: {}.

Available features:

* **manager**: script in /usr/local to start/stop all daemons relevant for given node

####`keytab`

Impala keytab file for catalog and statestore services. Default: '/etc/security/keytab/impala.service.keytab'.

It must contain impala principal:

* impala/&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;

####`parameters`

Daemon parameters to set. Default: undef.

Value is a hash with *catalog*, *server*, and *statestore* keys.

####`realm`

Kerberos realm. Default: undef.

Non-empty value enables Kerberos security.

####`servers`

Array of Impala server hostnames. Default: [$::fqdn].

####`statestore_hostname`

Statestore service hostname. Default: $::fqdn.

####`udf_enable`

Installs also headers on the frontend for development of user defined queries. Default: true.

## Limitations

Hadoop cluster and Hive metastore is required. See [Setup Requirements](#requirements).

This module setup Impala cluster and tries to not limit generic usage by doing other stuff. You can have your own repository with Hadoop SW, you can select which Kerberos implementation, or Java version to use. All of that you will probably already have for the Hadoop cluster.

Security is not working yet and usage with sentry has not been tested.
